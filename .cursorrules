# Documentation: Timeline & changelog for big updates

When you or the user complete a **big update** or **note worthy** update, log it in `./documentation/` as markdown.

## What counts as a big update

- New feature or major behavior change
- Refactor touching multiple files
- API or integration changes
- UI/UX overhaul or new screens
- Bug fix or change that affects behavior in a notable way

When in doubt, log it—short entries are fine.

## Where to log

- **Changelog (timeline):** `documentation/CHANGELOG.md` — append new entries at the top.
- **Optional:** One-off docs (e.g. `documentation/2025-02-02-quote-api-update.md`) for large or complex updates.

## Changelog entry format

Use this format in `documentation/CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — Short title

- **Summary:** One line describing the update.
- **Files changed:** (optional) List key files or areas (e.g. `widget.js`, `apis/`, settings).
- **Changes:**
  - Change 1
  - Change 2
  - …
```

## When to update

- **Before finishing:** After implementing a big update, add or update the changelog (and any one-off doc) before considering the task done.
- **Tip:** If the user says "this was a big update" or "log this," always create or append the entry.

Keep entries brief and scannable; use the optional one-off markdown files in `./documentation/` for longer explanations.
